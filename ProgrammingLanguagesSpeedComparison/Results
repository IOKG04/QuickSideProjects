Printing test:	~13,000	653,925	7,368
If test:	~ 0,000	  8,772	0,749

Counting test:	Add all numbers from 0 to 9,999,999,999 to an integer
Printing test:	Print '-' 1,000,000,000 times
If test:	For all numbers from 0 to 9,999,999,999:
			Increment an int by one if the number % 2 == 0
			Decrement an int by one if the number % 3 == 0
